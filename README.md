*play sum music with sum haptics :D*


**Hey Hey Hey 👋!** 

Ryan here, I'm experimenting with converting music (in the form of .wav files) into haptics (ahap files) :D. Heres a repo showcasing my progress so far-. 

## Try it yourself
Wanna ~~ feel ~~ my progress? Just:
1. Clone this repo to your local Mac
2. Open the xcode project
3. build and run to a device with a haptic engine! [That means iPhone 8 or later]

## Current Songs
The songs that are in this demo app include:
- In My Blood by **Shawn Mendes**
- Heat Waves by **Glass Animals**

## Note from 👦🏻
Have fun :D. I'll keep working on it and checkback to see if I update the repo with better, newer, haptics : D.
