# MusicWitHaptics
*play sum music with sum haptics :D*


**Hey Hey Hey üëã!** 

Ryan here, I'm experimenting with converting music (in the form of .wav files) into haptics (ahap files) :D. Heres a repo showcasing my progress so far-. The actual conversion of music to haptic isn't included in this repo just yet- might publish to a different seperate repo eventually. And for those of you wondering how it works- well its just sum python :D. 

## Try it yourself
Wanna ~~ feel ~~ my progress? Just:
1. Clone this repo to your local Mac
2. Open the xcode project
3. build and run to a device with a haptic engine! [That means iPhone 8 or later]

## Current Songs
The songs that are in this demo app include:
- In My Blood by **Shawn Mendes**
- Heat Waves by **Glass Animals**

**NOTE**: I obviously don't own the music in this app. Please contact the artist/label if you want to use it. If you need a song removed from this demo app, please drop an issue or email me at ryandu9221@gmail.com.

## Note from üë¶üèª
Have fun :D. I'll keep working on it and checkback to see if I update the repo with better, newer, haptics : D.
